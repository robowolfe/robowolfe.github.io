                        I just wrote about the Bible having many writers and one Originator, and this same idea of many and one applies to the main story of the Bible as well. Although each book or section of the Bible was written down by a different person and may have different themes or stories, an overarching narrative encompasses the whole of the Bible. This comes from the fact that there is only one Author, one main Person from who the entire Bible was created.

                        <h3>From <span style="color:var(--purple)">God</span> via human authors.</h3>
                        The Bible is both a divine book and a human book; this means that both God and man had their part in writing down the words. So, an obvious question arises: “Who is the author of the Bible?” However, we first need to define our terms, what does “author” really mean? I like this definition from Merriam Webster Dictionary: “1. the writer of a literary work (such as a book).” Just looking at that definition we can conclude that humans are the author of the Bible, right? Well, not exactly, “2. a. one that originates or creates something,” this sense of the definition describes God’s role in the creation of the Bible, and in fact, the next definition is: “2. b. capitalized : GOD.” I think Merriam Webster has the perfect definition of author. It shows that both the physical writer and the originator have a part in being the author, but ultimately, it is God who authored the Bible in its fullness. “All Scripture is God-breathed…” (2 Timothy 3:16) and therefore, the Bible’s words are God’s words, they come from Him through the hands of His chosen scribes. The Bible isn’t some history book with a bunch of authors; it’s a book with one Author (Originator) and many penmen (writers).

                    <div class="text-fit">In Luke 24 and John 5, Jesus describes how everything written in the Old Testament witnesses of Him and how He has come to fulfill all the prophecies. And in His fulfillment, Jesus will also bring the law to its intended goal (Matthew 5). Not only does Jesus declare this in the Sermon on the Mount, but Peter preaches this in the past tense on the day of Pentecost. Peter tells the crowd how Jesus had fulfilled all that was spoken of Him, pointing to Joel and Psalms specifically. These passages highlight the connection between the Old and the New Testaments: Jesus. From the Fall and the need for Jesus to Revelation and the returning of Jesus the Bible points to a need for a Savior, the Savior. </div>

                        The four major plot movements are Creation, Fall, Redemption, and Restoration. Creation is God’s perfect world where we were made to love, serve, and glorify Him. However, we as humans sinned, breaking a relationship with God and creating the need for Christ. Redemption is God’s saving of our broken relationship with Him and addressing our sin through Christ’s death and resurrection. Finally, restoration is when God recreates that perfect world where we love, serve, and glorify Him, but for eternity in heaven and on a new creation.

                        In the Old Testament the story for the rest of the Bible is set up: the need for a Savior and the prophesy of Him (as stated in the previous question). The New Testament is the fulfilling of what the Old Testament prophesied of and the promise of a time where we will be with Christ. From Adam being a type of Christ, to the Passover being a representation of Him, Christ is throughout the Bible in places that aren’t as obvious as prophesy or the Gospels. Christ’s coming is the climax of the story, dividing the Biblical account into two parts, anticipation and expounding (CBE 50-51).

                        There are 8 major sections to the Bible: the Pentateuch, Historical Books, Wisdom Literature, Prophetic Books, Gospels, Acts, Letters, and Revelation. The Pentateuch focuses on God’s creation of the universe, our need for a savior, and the start of God’s plan to redeem His people. The Historical Books give a storyline of God’s chosen people as they turn against God Himself, showing our need for a Someone to save us from our sins. The Wisdom Literature is a contrast to Israel’s sin, showing us how to live a godly lifestyle. The Prophetic Books tell of Someone who can live that godly lifestyle perfectly, Someone who can mend our broken relationship with God. The Gospels are the books describing Jesus’s life and ministry on earth, written as historical records and directed to different people groups. Acts describes the ministry and the people of the early church as the Gospel spread to the nations, and the Letters were written to the churches of the world as they spread. Revelation is the final book and the conclusion of both the prophesies of Christ and the destruction of sin, death, and destruction.

                        There are six covenants in the Bible also help set up the Biblical storyline, but what is a covenant? A covenant is like a contract between God and another party, but with an additional emphasis on a relationship between the two. The first is the Adamic covenant in Genesis 3:15, where Jesus is promised as the seed of Adam and Eve who will crush human sin and reconnect our relationship with God. The next is the Noahic in Genesis 6-9, showing the depravity of the human condition, and the need the Savior mentioned in the Adamic covenant. It also promised that God would never slaughter the whole world with a flood again. The third is the Abrahamic throughout Genesis 12-22, where God promises Abraham to make his children uncountable, turn them into a great nation for His glory, and bless the nations through them. The Mosaic covenant in Exodus 19 builds directly upon the Abrahamic, setting up laws to set Israel apart from other nations and protecting them as God’s chosen people. The Davidic covenant in 2 Samuel 7 sets up the lineage of the spoken Savior in the Adamic, picking the ruler over Israel and promising that The Seed would come through him. Finally, the New Covenant prophesied in Jeremiah 31:31 wraps up the covenants by mending our relationship to God by sending a Savior to come, suffer, and take the punishment for our sin on His shoulders to save us.

                        The Bible starts by describing how all things, immaterial and material, come from the direct act of God speaking them into existence (Gen. 1). He created rules about how the world works called creational norms, establishing patterns into the very nature of creation. Because God created all things, He also created humans, but more specifically, He created humans in the image of Himself (Gen. 1:27). We, therefore, must be mirrors of the One who created us, reflecting God in all we do.

                        This promise of a Seed who will save us from our sins is fulfilled through Christ when He died on the cross. The wrath of God was taken upon Him, covering the cost of the penalty for our sins and giving us a divine grace that we don’t deserve. Through His son, He is now able to bring us back into a relationship with Him, where we can glorify and praise Him forever.

                        However, we aren’t perfect, and there are times where we aren’t reflecting who God is in His perfection. One of these many times is called the Fall (Gen. 3:1-7), the first time when humanity sinned, cursing all who will come after (Gen 3:16-19). The effects of the Fall alter how we view the world drastically. Because humans are cursed, we now deal with suffering (v19a), pain (v16), and death (v19b). But God also made a promise to us (v15): that He would provide a Savior to bring us back into a loving relationship with Him.

                        Although this story is one of the most depressing videos I’ve ever watched, it has plenty of lessons we can learn from it. More than anything else, this shows the absolute and irreversible sin that has entered the hearts of man because of the Fall. Even when everything was good and everyone was happy, sin was still scheming in the background, directly affecting those around and related to us. It also shows man’s fallen version of redemption, a justice system that can only punish, not restore: Timothy will never live again, even though “justice was served.” And from another perspective we have the idea of capital punishment, should someone be killed because they have killed, and what qualification does one man have to kill another man for their crime? There is only one answer to these questions and the frightening reality of sin, the ultimate restoration through Christ, the only righteous judge.

                        <h3>Summary</h3>
                        At the beginning of this story, a well-known and well-liked churchgoing father took his family out Trick-or-Treating. Everything was good, everyone was happy. However, when they got home one of the children, Timothy, fell limp and died almost instantly while eating a Pixie Stix. Detectives soon found that he was poisoned with enough potassium cyanide to kill two fully grown adults. Upon further investigation, the only suspect found except the father, Ronald Clark. He had just recently taken out two $50k insurance policies on his children. Because of this and plenty of other evidence, he was sentenced to death by electric chair for one count of capital murder and four counts of attempted murder.

                        A lot of times as children we are told “Bible stories” or little segments from certain books of the Bible that we almost consider non-fictional fables. However, the Bible isn’t meant to just be read as a collection of unrelated moral stories, but as a collection of stories that all point to the necessity, life, and actions of Christ. Viewing the Bible in this way allows you to apply these of these stories and their application to Christ to the way that you live your life, also known as a Biblical worldview. If you haven’t read the Bible in the context of its focus on Christ, I would recommend you re-read it in light of this. I had previously viewed the Bible as a collection of messages, books about rules, history, and other topics that to me just didn’t make sense together. But viewing the Old and New Testaments as one connected thought by a single Author allows you to see the allusions to God’s ultimate plan of our redemption through Christ. If you’ve never read the Bible before, this is my plea to you to do so. If you haven’t trusted in Christ as the Savior who died a torturous death on a cross to save you from your sins and rose from the grave, I beg you to find a pastor and talk about how you can do that. I hope you enjoyed reading about what I believe, and I hope you are encouraged by what you read.

                    <h2>Podcast</h2>
                    <p>In this podcast me and my dad go in depth on how the Bible storyline effects us as Christians and how it effects non-believers. We touched on topics like keeping the Creation Mandate while not being directly on the mission field and how Christians should view suffering within a Biblical worldview. These are topics that many Christians and non-believers struggle with, and we were able to answer some of those questions. Enjoy listening!</p>
