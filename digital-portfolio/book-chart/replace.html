<div class="row look-b"><div class="cell">Looking Back</div><div class="cell">Revelation is the conclusion to the Bible, and more importantly, the prophesy of the conclusion of sin, death, and destruction. The relationship between God and man is restored, allowing for harmony together again. Life is restored to the way it was in the garden of Eden, free from sin and with communion and worship to God.</div></div>
<div class="row look-f"><div class="cell">Looking Forward</div><div class="cell">This is the section about Christ’s absolute and complete overcoming of sin. This fully ties together all the prophesies about Christ, showing Him as the One and true Messiah. He establishes His eternal kingdom for us as believers, dwelling together in love.</div></div>
